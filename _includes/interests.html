          My main research interests include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Processor Verification</b>. My work focuses on discovering CPU vulnerabilities through fuzz testing. I have addressed key challenges in CPU fuzzing, including test redundancy, imbalance, and false positives. 
            Specifically, I (1) proposed diversified test construction, (2) introduced a novel coverage metric, (3) designed a new mutation algorithm, (4) overcame large-scale verification bottlenecks for non-standard instructions, and (5) pioneered a seed scheduling strategy tailored for CPU fuzzing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Side-Channel Security</b>. I have studied and reproduced various side-channel attacks, gaining practical insights into their mechanisms and countermeasures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Memory Safety</b>. I am interested in exploring memory safety from both hardware and system perspectives, including memory corruption detection, pointer integrity, and runtime monitoring techniques, aiming to mitigate security risks in modern processors.
          </li>
        </ul>
